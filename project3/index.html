    <h1>KEM</h1>
    	<p>Born Kem Owens from Nashville, Tennessee. He is a Neo-Soul, Contemporary, R&B artist. KEM has been driven by music and the emotions in bringing it to life. 
        That passion stems from the days he spent as a child playing the old piano at his grandfather’s church. </p>
      
      <p>Today, the internationally renowned R&B singer/songwriter has to his credit: one Platinum-selling album (KEM: ALBUM II); 
        two Gold-selling albums (KEMISTRY; INTIMACY); three GRAMMY nominations; five #1 hit singles (“Love Calls,” “I Can’t Stop Loving You,” 
        “Why Would You Stay,” “It’s You,” and “Nobody”), along with several sold-out national tours and international shows. </p>
      
      <p>In spite of his success in the world of R&B, many still don’t know the true depths of KEM, his music, his passion for songwriting, or his journey from
        homelessness and addiction to sobriety that has given life to his music and thousands of fans. Consequently, he’s often called “R&B’s Best Kept Secret.” </p>
      
      <h2>Road to Success</h2>
      <p>Much of the inspiration for KEM’s music began taking root after the artist graduated from high school and found his life in a downward spiral from
          deep-seated personal issues that resulted in him turning to alcohol and drugs as a coping mechanism. Frustrated with his unwillingness 
          to seek help, his mother was forced to kick him out of the house. KEM’s life became entrenched in out-of-drug rehab centers and homeless shelters. </p>
      
      <p>KEM finally hit rock bottom on the night of July 22, 1990, when he was kicked out and relegated to sleeping outside after breaking shelter rules. 
          As he sat on the banks of the Detroit River that night, KEM realized that he was “sick and tired of being sick and tired.” And in a break from his 
          regular routine of trying to map out his own road in life, KEM decided to hand all his future plans over to God. </p>
      
      <p>Throughout his journey to sobriety, KEM continued to write his music. On February 28, 2002, KEM independently released his first CD, KEMISTRY, but it
        wasn’t an overnight success. Driven then more than ever, the artist sold more than 15,000 units, literally out of the trunk of his car. The success
        landed him a meeting with Motown Records. They quickly signed KEM to a five-record deal in November 2001 and re-released KEMISTRY on the Motown label
        in 2002. His first hit, “Love Calls,” jetted to #1 on Urban Adult Contemporary charts and continues to be played on R&B radio stations to this day
        as an undisputed classic. </p>

      <p>Kem has performed with many top industry R&B artists.  KEM’s five albums have sold in excess of 2.9 million units achieved Platinum-selling and became a
        three-time GRAMMY®-nominated artist. He has received two NAACP Image Awards, two Soul Train Award, and the BET Centric Award. </p>
