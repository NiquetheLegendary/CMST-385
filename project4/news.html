	</div>
	<div>
	   <p>R&B legend Kem, whose real name is Kim Lamont Owens, is married to wife Erica. She is seen to share her husband’s passion for music as she is a DJ. 
	     Erica is also said to have inspired some of her husband’s new music. While appearing on Ricky Smiley’s Morning Show in 2020, Kem revealed his then-new 
	     track Lie To Me was about her. </p>
	  <p>Kem met his now-wife Erica during a meet and greet in Atlanta, Georgia. Two years later, on the anniversary of their first date, Kem popped the question. 
	     They got married in 2019 and are set to celebrate their 3rd wedding anniversary this November.  </p>
